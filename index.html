<h1> Subway Ridership Still Down 30-50%, Expert Suggests What Needs To Happen Next </h1>
<!-- SUBHEAD -->
<div class="subhead">
<p> Xian Di, Columbia Researcher and Professor of Engineering, suggests that reduced subway ridership is indication that the subway is still seen as a place of higher covid transmission. She suggests that in order to get people back to work and revitalize the economy, measures will have to be taken to ease subway commuter anxiety. </p>

<!-- STORY -->

<div class="containerparagraph">
  <p1> The pandemic has impacted daily subway ridership in a way even experts didn’t anticipate. The MTA publishes day-by-day ridership numbers to help New Yorkers understand how many people are using transit services in and around New York City. This information allows us to see how ridership has changes from March 2020 to present. Immediatey, one can see that not only did the pandemic reduce ridership in a significant way, but that the impact has persisted. </p1>
</div>

<div class="containerparagraph">
<p1> Xuan Di is an associate professor of civil engineering and engineering mechanics at Columbia. She studies travel behavior and transportation systems. Her focus is on behavior during disrupted networks, such as after a hurricane or structural failure, working to imagine and engineer designs of resilient infrastructure. </p1>
</div>

<div class="containerparagraph">
<p1> “I was a little surprised to see still such a negative change,” said Di when confronted with the new data. After initially checking the data a few months ago when everything started opening up in NYC, she predicted ridership would steadily increase. She looked at the bridge and tunnel traffic, observing that it was the only type of transportation traffic that had returned to pre pandemic levels, signalling to her that the subway decrease was spurred from concern over saftey. “My guess is that people are probably still not comfortable taking public transit. So the most urgent thing now is to ease people's concerns.” </p1>

<!-- KICKER -->
<div class="containerparagraph">
<p1> Di beleives that availability to public transportation is necessary for the revitalization of the New York City economy. She beleives that people are avoiding taking the subway because it is seen as a place with higher covid transmission. In response, her team is working on building technology that allows subway commuters to use an app on their phone to check whether there is a crowd on a platform or train, permitting them to stay in open air until they can more safely commute. The software will also have an interface so that users can self report on crowding, permitting New Yorkers to work collaboratively to inspire growth in subway ridership. </p1>
